This repository contains the [.NET Core](http://github.com/dotnet/core) version of the [Windows Communication Foundation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd456779.aspx) client libraries.

It's a subset of the .NET Framework version of Windows Communication Foundation and currently supports the same functionality available for Windows 8.1 Store apps. It is used to build .NET Core apps, including [Windows UWP](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/dn609832.aspx) and [ASP.NET 5](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/introducing-asp-net-5). These client libraries are suitable for mobile devices or on mid-tier servers to communicate with existing WCF services.

By targeting .NET Core, WCF now has the opportunity for much wider reach across PCs, laptops, mobile devices, Xbox, HoloLens etc.  It can also be ported to other operating systems since it runs on .NET Core, which is adding support for Linux and OS X.

We have deliberately opened the doors to the code early in the process so that you can be part of the effort by contributing to the project or providing feedback. Several features are still a work in progress, and we expect to enable them as soon as possible.  Click on [Issues](https://github.com/dotnet/wcf/issues) to follow how we are prioritizing the work. Our goal is to achieve feature parity with the corresponding Windows Store libraries and then improve based on your feedback.

## How to Engage, Contribute and Provide Feedback

Some of the best ways to contribute are to try things out, file bugs, and join in design conversations.

## WCF Library Components

This repo contains the following library components.

* **System.ServiceModel.Primitives**.  Provides the common types used by all of the WCF libraries.

* **System.ServiceModel.Http**. Provides the types that permit SOAP messages to be exchanged using Http (example: BasicHttpBinding).

* **System.ServiceModel.NetTcp**. Provides the types that permit SOAP messages to be exchanged using TCP (example: NetTcpBinding).
 
* **System.ServiceModel.Duplex**. Provides the types that permit 2-way ("duplex") exchanges of messages.  This library is currently under construction and not yet fully functional.

* **System.ServiceModel.Security**. Provides the types that support additional security features.  This library is currently under construction and not yet fully functional.

## The Windows Communication Foundation Story

[Windows Communication Foundation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd456779.aspx) has been part of the full .NET Framework for a number of years. Microsoft continues to develop this version and has made the source code available via [Reference Source](http://referencesource.microsoft.com).

With the introduction of Windows 8, Microsoft made some of the client-oriented functionality available in the [Windows Store](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh556233(v=vs.110).aspx).  This allowed mobile devices to interact with WCF services that were built with the .NET framework version.

This new WCF GitHub repository differs from these other products in 2 ways. First, it is built on .NET Core so that it can be used on a wider range of devices and operating system. Second, it is  open-source and managed by the [.NET Foundation](http://www.dotnetfoundation.org/projects). Microsoft builds  and publishes NuGet packages from the code in this repository.  UWP and ASP.NET 5 applications use those packages.
